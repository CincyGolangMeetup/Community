# Community

A simple guideline for working the with community and how to best participate with Cincy Golang Meetup group.

**This document is a work in progress.**

This page is a reference for interacting with the Cincinnati Golang Community. We hope to engage with as many people as we can and create a welcoming environment for everyone. For the time being, we will follow the guidelines introduced [here](https://golang.org/conduct]). Generally speaking, be respectful of others.

## How To Get Involved
There are a few ways to be involved with the Cincinnati Golang Meetup github page.


1. **As a student:** All the material here is open source and we welcome anyone to use this info for learning purposes. Wh hope that as you take a look at the material, you will gain valuable insight into learning and growing as a Go developer.

1.  **As a contributor:** If you are interested in helping create content for others in the community, we would love for you to write some code and teach others the knowledge that you have learned. You don't need to be an expert to help and we encourage others to give their unique insights. The two main places to contribute currently are in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/CincyGolangMeetup/Tutorials) repo and the [Workshops](https://github.com/CincyGolangMeetup/TuWorkshops) repo.
    > **If you have an idea for a tutorial or workshop and want to implement it, make a quick issue on that repo, just so we don't have overlapping tutorials.**

1.  **As a teacher or organizer:** As mentioned above, all the material here is open source and is free to use for training and other workshops. If you would like to use the Workshops created here, that would be great. We are here to help you get setup if you have any questions. Although, our main target is the Cincinnati community, anyone can use this material (and we hope you do).

### Creating Issues
Although, we do our best to ensure that all the material is accurate and ideomatic Go code, if you find something that is broken, wrong, or out-of-date, please file an issue in the relavent repo. We will do our best to fix any issues. If you want to fix any issues, please see the section on Pull Requests.

### Pull Requests
If you want to contribute, the best way to do so is to create a pull request. If you are new to github, [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) is a guide from Github on how to do so.

Here are the steps we ask you to follow when creating content:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-name>`
1. Create a branch from master: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
1. Make any changes you want on your branch.
1. Create a pull request from your branch to the master branch

The core maintainers will do our best to merge requests as quickly as possible.

If you have any issues getting started, let us know by creating an issue.
